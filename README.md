# Diabetes Prediction using Logistic Regression

## Problem Statement:
    
You work in XYZ Company as a Python Data Scientist. The company officials have collected some data on
Health parameter based on Diabetes and wish for you to create a model from it.

## Dataset:  _[diabetes.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabh00007/diabetescsv)_

## Tasks to be performed

1. Load the dataset using pandas
2. Extract data from Outcome column in a variable named Y
3. Extract data from every column except Outcome column in a variable named X
4. Divide the dataset into two parts for training and testing in 70% and 30% proportion
5. Create and train Logistic Regression Model on training set
6. Make predictions based on the testing set using the trained model
7. Check the performance by calculating the confusion matrix and accuracy score of the model
